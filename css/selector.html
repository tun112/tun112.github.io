    <p>
        Hamsters, for many people, make excell
        ent pets. They don't require a lot of a
        ttention, get enough exercise running on 
        their wheel, and are cute, cuddly, and plea
        n make an excellent starter pet for some 
        children. Unfortunately, hamsters don't co
        me with care instructions.</p>
