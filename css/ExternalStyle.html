        Hamsters, for many people, make excellent pets. 
        They don't require a lot of attention, get eno
        ugh exercise running on their wheel, and are cut
        e, cuddly, and pleasant to hold. They can make 
        an excellent starter pet for some children. Unfo
        tunately, hamsters don't come with care instructions.</span>
